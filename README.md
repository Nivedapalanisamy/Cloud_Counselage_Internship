*•	Data Exploration:* Conduct initial exploratory data analysis to understand the structure, quality, and characteristics of the collected data.

*•	Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:* Perform data cleaning tasks such as handling missing values, addressing outliers, standardizing formats, and ensuring data consistency.

*•	Statistical Analysis:* Utilize statistical methods to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations within the data, providing valuable insights into the relationships between different variables.

*•	Data Visualization:* Develop visualizations such as charts, graphs, and dashboards to represent data trends, distributions, and relationships visually, facilitating easier interpretation and communication of findings.
